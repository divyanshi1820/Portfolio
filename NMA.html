      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Nikhil Mahashur, an esteemed alumnus of IES college, has extensive experience in the architectural industry, having been active in the field since early 2000s. Under his leadership, NMA has grown to become one of the notable architectural firms in South Mumbai. The firm's portfolio includes a diverse range of projects, from residential and commercial buildings to restoration projects and construction project management. Their services encompass all aspects of architecture, including designing, detailing, and managing entire sites. This holistic approach ensures that each project is handled with a high level of detail and professionalism.

      <h3>Concept & Process</h3>

      <p>
        The concept stems from the idea of a “second skin”—a protective exoskeleton that shelters the research modules from harsh wind, snow accumulation, and thermal loss. The form evolves through parametric design using Grasshopper, adapting to functional zoning, terrain contours, and solar orientation.

      <p>
        Interior modules are suspended inside this exoskeleton, allowing wind to pass beneath and around, while maintaining thermal isolation. Modular clusters follow a programmatic spine: residential, laboratory, operations, and logistics, with utility cores strategically placed for maintenance efficiency.
